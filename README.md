### Introduction
#### What is Yakkee?
##### Yakkee is a communication platform designed for seniors first. 

Yakkee is an open-source project with a mission to build a communication platform designed seniors-first. In essence, this means we want to adapt the interface to the user and not the other way around. Currently the goal is to create a conversational interface so that users only have to tell yakkee what they want to do.
