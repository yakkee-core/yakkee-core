### Introduction
#### What is Yakkee?
##### Yakkee is a communication platform designed for seniors first. 

Yakkee is an open-source project with a mission to build a communication platform designed seniors-first. Think of it as senior-centric. 

In essence, this means we build a network around a senior or senior couple so that everyone in their network is people they know. We also adapt the interface to them instead of asking them to learn how to use our service. Currently the goal is to create a conversational interface so that users only have to tell Yakkee what they want to do.
